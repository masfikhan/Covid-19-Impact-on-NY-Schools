            Public schools in New York City have long been segregated by race and socio-economic class. Given that 13.3 percent of students are English Language Learners and 73 percent of students are economically disadvantaged, these divisions have formed educational disparities. As the city was once the national COVID-19 epicenter with over 203,000 confirmed positive cases between March and June 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has compounded its health, economic, and racial inequalities, which raises concerns about the effects on public school education. This data visualization project examines three categories of access pertinent to students' needs–health, broadband, and meals–within three types of political geography in the city, including boroughs, zip codes, and school districts. It also provides contextual information on geographic locations and maps initiatives led by the city to combat these gaps. Using datasets from the city's Open Data portal, the U.S. Census, and New York Government data on COVID-19 statistics, broadband infrastructure, and meal and testing program locations, I produced three sets of interactive visualizations using D3.js, a JavaScript library. These visualizations show the severe magnitudes of disparities and the correlations between social demographics, access to resources, and outcomes. For instance, there are varying levels of broadband access between zip codes and there is a high correlation between a district's economic need and its students' academic performance on state exams. This multi-level survey of the city can identify high-need locations and drive targeted efforts to address educational disparities.        </p>
